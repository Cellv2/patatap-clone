# Idea

Simple incarnation of [patatap.com](https://patatap.com/ "https://patatap.com/")

[See it on Netlify](https://cellv2-patatap-clone.netlify.com/ "https://cellv2-patatap-clone.netlify.com/"), but please make sure to turn your volume down!

If running it locally, CORS errors will be in the console unless running off of an HTTP server - it's expected :relaxed:
